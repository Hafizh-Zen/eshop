<h2>Module 2 Reflection</h2>

<h3>1. Code Quality Issues & Fixes</h3>
<p>
  During this exercise, I fixed several code quality issues identified by SonarCloud and Scorecard. These included unused import statements, missing test coverage in the <code>ProductServiceImpl</code> class, and the absence of proper test method naming. 
  To address them, I removed unnecessary imports, added meaningful unit tests for uncovered service and repository logic, and ensured better naming conventions for test methods to improve clarity.
</p>

<h3>2. CI/CD Workflow Evaluation</h3>
<p>
  The CI/CD implementation meets the definition of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. The workflow automatically runs unit tests, performs code quality checks using Scorecard and SonarCloud, and deploys the application to Koyeb via Docker. 
  Every push to the <code>main</code> branch triggers this pipeline, ensuring that all changes are tested and deployed consistently. 
  This setup improves delivery speed and reduces the risk of introducing errors into production.
